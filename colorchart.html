        <h2 align="center">How to Take Care of Your Hair</h2>
        <p>All human hair must be shampooed and conditioned. With your new human hair extensions you will also need to know what not to do. <em>Protect hair from perspiration, chlorine and salt water.</em> If you are in or near salt water or chlorine coat your hair with Paul Mitchell&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Conditioner&rdquo; before exposure. Do not let hair dry before brushing out any and all tangles, and shampoo ASAP after such exposure. Always use a good clarifying shampoo. Followed with the conditioner you can only find in L&rsquo;Oreal do it yourself color kits. Call me for details before using this conditioner…follow up again with &ldquo;The Conditioner&rdquo; let dry before laying on it. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent"><strong>Caution:</strong> <em>Never sleep on wet and/or tangled hair. Always brush hair out and let hair dry, when hair is almost dry… Use Moisturizing oil (Moroccan, etc.) put in Genie Roll for straight and wavy hair. For Curly or Wavy use moisturizing cream or lotion, put in large braided(s) for curly hair.</em></p></blockquote>
          <p>If your hair is dry use a <strong>moisturizing shampoo</strong>…avoid shampoos with a lot of alcohol. Always brush through to remove any tangles before shampooing. Use a Teflon tipped brush to brush hair thoroughly starting at the end, working upwards towards the scalp. Gently, lightly remove all tangles. Do not tangle hair during shampoo, scrub and clean the scalp, then pull fingers through the rest of the hair. Rinse with warm water.</p>
          <p>After shampoo use a good <strong>moisturizing conditioner</strong> (see suggested products). Leave conditioner on as long as you like A moisturizing conditioner can not/will not harm your hair. Rinse well with COLD water. </p>
        <h3 class="hairstory">Care for Caucasian Straight and Body Wave Hair</h3>
        <p>All human hair needs oil. Because of its uniqueness Caucasian/European hair gets oil from the scalp. As a rule of thumb Caucasians must shampoo frequently, some even daily. This is very damaging to the hair, because shampoo removes oils &ldquo;all hair needs oil&rdquo;! So every time you shampoo the oil out, the scalp makes more. The result; you have a superfluous amount of oil in your hair, yet your hair feels dry and is damaged… especially if you color/bleach your hair. Shampoo contains detergent, which deters/ removes oil.</p>
        <p><strong>Shampoo your hair only as necessary</strong>. Remember all hair needs oil. So when your scalp produces too much oil, instead of shampooing it out, your new European hair, which now has no scalp, will absorb these excessive oils. Most of my clients find it necessary to shampoo only once or twice a week. This sometimes leaves oil in the crown area where there is no extension hair. In this case shampoo the area as needed for good hygiene. But shampoo the crown area only.… Tip: Use the ckitchen sink, by pulling only the top hair forward to shampoo the hair and clean the scalp. Use the veggie sprayer to rinse hair forward in sink.</p>
        <p><strong>To Shampoo the whole head:</strong> Always shampoo with warm water, and always rinse with COLD water. Never use hot water on your hair. Cold water will close the cuticle, this makes the hair easier to comb and brush through….it will also add luster and shine to the hair. Hot water dries hair, causes tangles and breakage, leaving hair dull, lack luster. Imagine putting a wool sweater in hot water!</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent"><em>Tip:</em> Cold water can be uncomfortable in the shower, so rinse with luke warm water and then…Just spray hair with cold water. You should shampoo at least once a week in cold weather, and no more than twice a week in hot weather. If lifestyle dictates more frequency…just use a conditioner like a shampoo. Do not use products high in alcohol content. Look for low or no sulfate products.        </p>
        </blockquote>
		  
        <h3 class="hairstory">Care for Asian Hair</h3>
        <p>You will know the type of hair you have, based on your race. Basically anyone who is not #510972 or black is Asian. Your hair could be curly, straight or wavy. This hair requires oil. Shampoo and condition as directed above. Use moisturizing products and avoid alcohol.</p>
        <p>You should use what ever products you have used (successfully) on your own hair or see my recommendations. Straight or Wavy hair: To add shine and relieve dullness in your Use an &ldquo;Oil Sheen Spray&rdquo; and/or natural oils like Moroccan, Coconut Oil etc.</p>
        <p>For<strong> curl definition</strong> use &ldquo;Curl Activators, Curl Moisturizers, Curl Boosters, etc. These products will define your curls. Finish with a Finishing mist or oil sheen spray to make hair look rich and vibrant. These products are typically sold in the &ldquo;Ethnic&rdquo; hair care section in most stores, there are various brands to choose from. I prefer &ldquo;Wave Neuveau&rdquo; Moisturizing Finishing Lotion followed by their Moisturizing Finishing Mist. Spray hair with COLD water before using Finishing Lotions. This will help you avoid over use causing hair to be heavy and sticky. Use fingers to define your curl pattern(s) use products as directed. You may also try other manufactures curl grooming products, John Freeda or L&rsquo;Oreal, and other manufacturers also make curl defining products, avoid products containing a lot of alcohol. This will dry the hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="hairstory">Care for Afro Hair (Including Afro Asiatic, Mediterranean and Some Persians)</h3>
        <p>Relaxed, Perm Straight, Deep Wave, Brazilian, and Malaysian, Indian Temple. All of these hair types require oils to be added. Unlike Caucasians; these people(s) scalps sweat water and that causes dryness, often producing dry dandruff. If you have dry scalp especially with dandruff you must use natural oils as well as solid hair and scalp oils (grease) on your scalp at least twice a week in cold weather about once a week in hot weather or as needed.</p>
        <p>Always use a<strong> moisturizing shampoo</strong>. Most shampoos made for Ethnics use natural oils instead of alcohol, once again they are found in a small &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; area in the store. If these products are not readily available in your area there is always Amazon. Some manufacturers like Pantene and L&rsquo;Oreal now make products for Afro hair, but most don&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p>Use a <strong>moisturizing conditioner</strong> for Black hair only after shampooing (others may have alcohol as their main ingredient). There are many Brands and products I do not recommend Revlon products. Use Paul Mitchell &ldquo;The Conditioner&rdquo; a leave in conditioner between shampoos to keep hair soft and pliant. </p>
