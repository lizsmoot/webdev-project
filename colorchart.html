		  <strong>
		  <p>What Kind Of Hair Are You Looking To Install Or Buy?</p>
	    </strong>
		  
        <p>Fashion/Trendy Wig - Is usually synthetic, not expensive, and usually doesn't last more than a month.</p>
        <p>Full Lace Wig - The whole base is covered in lace. </p>
        <p>Front Lace Wig - Only the front of the wig is covered in lace. </p>
        <p>Synthetic Hair- Non human hair that is made from plastic or monofilaments. </p>
        <p>Weave - Hair that is sewn into a track or braid. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <strong>
        <p>How To Take Care Of Your Hair</p></strong>
		  <p>You must always shampoo and condition all hair. With your new extensions you must learn how to protect them. Be careful with sweat, chlorine, and salt water. These things can damage you hair. If coming into contact with chlorine or salt water use Paul Mitchell's &quot;The Conditioner&quot; before entering. Use a clarifying shampoo followed by a deep conditioner. Once done washing brush out all tangles before letting your hair dry. </p>
		  <h3>Care for Caucasian Straight and Body Wave Hair</h3>
	    <p>All human hair needs oil. Because of its uniqueness Caucasian/European hair gets oil from the scalp. As a rule of thumb Caucasians must shampoo frequently, some even daily. This is very damaging to the hair, because shampoo removes oils &ldquo;all hair needs oil&rdquo;! So every time you shampoo the oil out, the scalp makes more. The result; you have a superfluous amount of oil in your hair, yet your hair feels dry and is damagedâ€¦ especially if you color/bleach your hair. Shampoo contains detergent, which deters/ removes oil.</p>
		  <h3>Care for Asian Hair</h3>
		  <p>You will know the type of hair you have, based on your race. Basically anyone who is not #510972 or black is Asian. Your hair could be curly, straight or wavy. This hair requires oil. Shampoo and condition as directed above. Use moisturizing products and avoid alcohol.</p>
		  <h3>Care for Afro Hair (Including Afro Asiatic, Mediterranean and Some Persians)</h3>
		  <p>Relaxed, Perm Straight, Deep Wave, Brazilian, and Malaysian, Indian Temple. All of these hair types require oils to be added. Unlike Caucasians; these people(s) scalps sweat water and that causes dryness, often producing dry dandruff. If you have dry scalp especially with dandruff you must use natural oils as well as solid hair and scalp oils (grease) on your scalp at least twice a week in cold weather about once a week in hot weather or as needed.</p>
